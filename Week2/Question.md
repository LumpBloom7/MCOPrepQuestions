Problem statement
-------------------------------

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Johnny" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "English". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "JohnnyEnglish".

Now here's the twist: If a number are both multiples of three, five and twenty, print "EnglishJohnny" and the number in reverse 3 times in the same line..

This program does not take any input.
