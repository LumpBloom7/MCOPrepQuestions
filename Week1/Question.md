The circle bot.

Problem statement

Lumpy wants to create a bot that can calculate the circumference, volume, or area of a sphere or circle given its radius. It needs to run in a constant loop and not close after each cycle.

Knowing that Ï€ == 3.14, and that the radius could be in either integer or decimal format, help Lumpy create the the bot. It should first accept a single character char, being either c(circumference),v(volume) and a(area).

It should then accept a number(int or decimal) and calculate the results based on the character inputted.

Input format

c 14 
v 55 
a 25 



Output format

87.92 units 
696909.97 units^3 
1963.495 units^2 



NOTE: It does not need to be 100 % precise.

Required knowledge

cin, cout, while, basic arithmetics, if else
